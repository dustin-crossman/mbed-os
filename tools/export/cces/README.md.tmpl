CrossCore Embedded Studio (CCES) can generate IDE projects from the command line using .json input files.

Run the following headless tools command to create your CrossCore Embedded Studio project using the .json file generated by the ARM mbed exporter:
> {{ project_create_command }}

where "WORKSPACE" is the path to the desired CCES workspace directory.

Once the CrossCore Embedded Studio project is generated, you can import the project into the IDE for development and debugging. You can also use headless tools to build the project with the following command:
> {{ project_build_command }}

where "WORKSPACE" is the path to the desired CCES workspace directory.

For more information on how to use CrossCore Embedded Studio and headless tools, please see the CrossCore Embedded Studio Help.
