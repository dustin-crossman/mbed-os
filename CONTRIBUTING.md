# Contributing to Mbed OS

Mbed OS is an open-source, device software platform for the internet of things. Contributions are an important part of the platform, and our goal is to make it as simple as possible to become a contributor.

To encourage productive collaboration, as well as robust, consistent and maintainable code, we have built a set of guidelines for contributing to Mbed OS. Please see: [contributing guidelines](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/reference/contributing.html).
