/**
 * Prevents generation of copy constructor and copy assignment operator in 
 * derived classes.
 * 
 * @par Usage
 * 
 * To prevent generation of copy constructor and copy assignment operator simply 
 * inherit privately from the NonCopyable class. 
 * 
 * @code 
 * class Resource : NonCopyable<Resource> { };
 * 
 * Resource r;
 * // generates compile time error:
 * Resource r2 = r;
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @par Background information
 * 
 * Instances of polymorphic classes are not meant to be copied. Unfortunately, 
 * the C++ standards generates a default copy constructor and copy assignment 
 * function if these functions have not been defined in the class.
 * 
 * Consider the following example:
 * 
 * @code
 * // base class representing a connection
 * struct Connection { 
 *     Connection();
 *     virtual ~Connection();
 *     virtual void open() = 0;
 * }
 * 
 * class SerialConnection : public Connection { 
 * public:
 *     SerialConnection(Serial*);
 * 
 * private:
 *     Serial* _serial;
 * };
 * 
 * Connection& get_connection() { 
 *     static SerialConnection serial_connection;
 *     return serial_connection;
 * }
 *
 * Connection connection = get_connection();
 * @endcode
 * 
 * There is a subtile bug in this code, the function get_connection returns a 
 * reference to a Connection which is captured by value instead of reference. 
 * 
 * When the reference returned by get_connection is copied into connection, the 
 * vtable and others members defined in Connection are copied but members defined
 * in SerialConnection are left apart. This can cause severe crashes or bugs if 
 * the virtual functions captured uses members not present in the base 
 * declaration. 
 * 
 * To solve that problem, the copy constructor and assignment operator have to 
 * be declared (but doesn't need to be defined) in the private section of the 
 * Connection class: 
 * 
 * @code
 * struct Connection { 
 * private:
 *     Connection(const Connection&);
 *     Connection& operator=(const Connection&);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * While manually declaring private copy constructor and assignment functions 
 * works, it is not ideal as these declarations are usually not immediately 
 * visible, easy to forget and may be obscure for uninformed programmer. 
 * 
 * Using the NonCopyable class reduce the boilerplate required and express 
 * clearly the intent as class inheritance appears right after the class name
 * declaration.
 * 
 * @code
 * struct Connection : private NonCopyable<Connection> { 
 *      // regular declarations
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * 
 * @par Implementation details 
 * 
 * Using a template type prevents cases where the empty base optimization cannot 
 * be applied and therefore ensure that the cost of the NonCopyable semantic 
 * sugar is null.
 * 
 * As an example, the empty base optimization is prohibited if one of the empty
 * base class is also a base type of the first non static data member:
 *
 * @code
 * struct A { };
 * struct B : A {
 *    int foo;
 * };
 * // thanks to empty base optimization, sizeof(B) == sizeof(int)
 *
 * struct C : A {
 *   B b;
 * };
 *
 * // empty base optimization cannot be applied here because A from C and A from
 * // B shall have a different address. In that case, with the alignment
 * // sizeof(C) == 2* sizeof(int)
 * @endcode
 *
 * The solution to that problem is to templatize the empty class to makes it
 * unique to the type it is applied to:
 *
 * @code
 * template<typename T>
 * struct A<T> { };
 * struct B : A<B> {
 *    int foo;
 * };
 * struct C : A<C> {
 *   B b;
 * };
 *
 * // empty base optimization can be applied B and C does not refer to the same
 * // kind of A. sizeof(C) == sizeof(B) == sizeof(int).
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam T The type that should be made non copyable. 
 *
 * @note Compile time errors are disabled if the develop or the release profile
 * is used. To override this behavior and force compile time errors in all profile
 * set the configuration parameter "platform.force-non-copyable-error" to true.
