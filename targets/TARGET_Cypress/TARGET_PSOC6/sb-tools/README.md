This directory contains tools and scripts for generating keys, preparing provisioning packets and execution of provisioning.
These files are relevant to CY8CPROTO_064_SB or CY8CPROTO_064_SB_M0_PSA, CY8CPROTO_064_SB_PSA targets.
Version of Python required is 3.7+

**_NOTE_:** Detailed description about Secure Boot tools availabe on this link https://www.cypress.com/secureboot-sdk-user-guide

# DEVICE PROVISIONING

## 1.   Generate new keys by executing the following commands from ./keys:

    *Create keys for image signing:*

    python keygen.py -k 8 --jwk USERAPP_CM4_KEY.json --pem-priv USERAPP_CM4_KEY_PRIV.pem

    *Create key for image encryption:*

    python keygen.py --aes aes.key

        
**_NOTE_:** DO NOT COMMIT any new keys to repository.

## 2.   Create provisioning packets:
Use *provisioning_packet.py* from ./prepare folder.

Options:

    --oem <filename>            OEM key file.
    --hsm <filename>            HSM key file.
    --cyboot <filename>         Cypress Bootloader image certificate.
    --cyauth <filename>         Provisioning authorization certificate.
    --policy <filename>         Policy file.
    --out <directory_path>      Output directory.
    --ckey <filename>           Customer key that will be used for image signing. Use the option multiple times to specify multiple keys.
    --devcert <filename>        Chain of trust certificate. Use the option multiple times to specify multiple certificates.

* To create packet for CY8CPROTO_064_SB target using single-stage policy (CM4 only):
    
        python provisioning_packet.py --policy policy_single_stage_CM4.json --out ../packet --cyboot ../prebuild/CyBootloader_Release/CypressBootloader_CM0p.jwt --ckey ../keys/USERAPP_CM4_KEY.json --devcert example_cert.pem
        
* To use external memory (via SMIF) as staging(upgrade) area (slot_1) of NSPE (CM4) image use policy file with corresponding name:

        python provisioning_packet.py --policy policy_single_stage_CM4_smif.json --out ../packet --cyboot ../prebuild/CyBootloader_Release/CypressBootloader_CM0p.jwt --ckey ../keys/USERAPP_CM4_KEY.json --devcert example_cert.pem
        
    The certificate in above examples is signed with OEM key from ./prebuild folder.
        
Prebuild folder contains CyBootloader_WithLogs and CyBootloader_Release with corresponding *.hex and *.jwt files.
  * WithLogs prints execution results to terminal.
  * Release does not print to terminal and boots up silently.

**_NOTE:_** CypressBootloader_CM0p.jwt and CypressBootloader_CM0p.hex must be used in pair from the same directory in provisioning packet generation (.packets/prov_cmd.jwt) and provisioning procedure itself.

## 3. Run entrance exam

        python entrance_exam_runner.py

## 4.   Perform provisioning:
**_ATTENTION:_** Proceed to **UPGRADE IMAGES** section first if UPGRADE image is needed.

Execute *provision_device_runner.py*.
The script will run with the default arguments if no arguments specified.

Default arguments can be overridden with a custom:

    --prov-jwt <filename>       Path to provisioning JWT file (packet which contains all data necessary for provisioning, including policy, authorization packets and keys)
    --hex <filename>            Path to Cypress Bootloader HEX binary file
    --pubkey-json <filename>    File where to save public key in JSON format
    --pubkey-pem <filename>     File where to save public key in PEM format

*Example:*
    
    python provision_device_runner.py --prov-jwt packet/prov_cmd.jwt --hex prebuild/CyBootloader_Release/CypressBootloader_CM0p.hex --pubkey-json keys/dev_pub_key.json --pubkey-pem keys/dev_pub_key.pem
    
**_NOTE:_** PSoC6 supply voltage of 2.5V is required to perform provisioning.

## UPGRADE IMAGES

Secure Boot enabled targets support image upgrades, if specified by policy. There are two types of upgrade images supported:
- signed, non encrypted
- signed, encrypted

The upgrade images types are determined by the following policy setting (firmware sections):

- **_"smif_id":_** 0, - should be set to 2 if AUGUST_CYW43012 target is used, 1 - if CY8CPROTO_064_SB, 0 - SMIF disabled
- **_"upgrade":_** true/false, - should be set to *true* if UPGRADE supported, *false* - if disabled
- **_"encrypt":_** true/false, - should be set to *true* if encrypted UPGRADE supported, *false* - if disabled
- **_"encrypt_key_id":_** 1, - should remain unchanged, means that Device Key will be used in ECDH/HKDF protocol

Requirements:
- Policy with **_smif.json** from prepare/ folder should be used.
For encrypted image:
- aes.key generated, as described in **DEVICE_PROVISIONING - 1**
- dev_pub_key.pem must be placed in keys/ folder (this key is generated in provisioning procedure)
- secure_image_parameters.json file in the target directory must contain valid keys' paths

Non encrypted UPGRADE image 
**_Example policy for CY8CPROTO_064_SB:_**
        
        "smif_id": 1,
        "upgrade": true,
        "encrypt": false,
        "encrypt_key_id": 1,

Encrypted UPGRADE image:

**_Example policy for CY8CPROTO_064_SB:_**
        
        "smif_id": 1,
        "upgrade": true,
        "encrypt": true,
        "encrypt_key_id": 1,

Modified policy file should be used for provisioning the device, as described in paragraph 4.

Now mbed-os application or test can be built as described in section **TESTS**. Images for UPGRADE are generated at build time, according to policy.

- Non enrypted UPGRADE image file name ends with **_upgrade.hex_**
- Enrypted UPGRADE image file name ends with **_enc_upgrade.hex_**

Upgrade image can be programmed to target board using Daplink. Upgrade procedure is performed after first reset.

**_Encrypt generic image:_**
The generic HEX file (for example one that is produced by mbed-os build system) can be converted into encrypted image by using encrypted_image_runner.py script located in sb-tools. Usage example:

        python encrypted_image_runner.py --sdk-path . --hex-file someApplication.hex --key-priv keys/MCUBOOT_CM0P_KEY_PRIV.pem --key-pub keys/dev_pub_key.pem --key-aes keys/aes.key --ver 0.1 --img-id 3 --rlb-count 0 --slot-size 0x50000 --pad 1 --img-offset 402653184
    
- **_--sdk-path_** - Path to Secure Boot tools folder
- **_--key-priv_** - ECC Private key used for image signing and for generating shared secret as per ECDH/HKDF.
- **_--key-pub_** - ECC Public key used for image signing and for generating shared secret as per ECDH/HKDF. Only device Key can be used in current implementation. It is generated by provisioning procedure.
- **_--key-aes_** - AES128 key and IV file raw image will be encrypted with.
- **_--img-id_** - Image ID of encrypted image. Must match one mentioned in policy for UPGRADE image.
- **_--slot-size_** - Slot_1 (UPGRADE) size. Must match one mentioned in policy for UPGRADE image.
- **_--ver_** - Version of image. Make sure it matches one defined in secure_image_parameters.json for a given HEX.
- **_--rlb-count_** - Rollback counter. Make sure it matches one defined in secure_image_parameters.json for a given HEX.
- **_--img-offset_** - Starting address offset for UPGRADE image - passed as integer, as represented in policy

# TESTS
        
1.  Build and run tests for CY8CPROTO_064_SB target with command:

        Run commands:
        mbed test --compile -m CY8CPROTO_064_SB -t GCC_ARM -n tests-mbed* -v

# TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. In case of messages like "unable to find device" execute "mbedls -m 1907:CY8CPROTO_064_SB", then check with "mbedls" if device is detected as CY8CPROTO_064_SB with code 1907.
2. Keys, from ./keys folder is used for signing images by default, these keys should be used for provisioning.
3. Consider using CyBootloader from CyBootloader_WithLogs folder. It produces logs, which are useful to understand whether CyBootloader works correctly.
4. When running application with SMIF and _smif.json policy the field "smif_id" should be set to 1 for CY8CPROTO_064_SB.
5. Low frequency quartz (32768 Hz) oscillator have to be soldered on CY8CPROTO_064_SB (not present in stock version of board).
