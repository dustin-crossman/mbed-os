 * \brief   This file contains AES definitions and functions.
 *
 *          The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved
 *          cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic
 *          data.
 *
 *          The AES algorithm is a symmetric block cipher that can
 *          encrypt and decrypt information. For more information, see
 *          <em>FIPS Publication 197: Advanced Encryption Standard</em> and
 *          <em>ISO/IEC 18033-2:2006: Information technology -- Security
 *          techniques -- Encryption algorithms -- Part 2: Asymmetric
 *          ciphers</em>.
 *
 *          The AES-XTS block mode is standardized by NIST SP 800-38E
 *          <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-38e.pdf>
 *          and described in detail by IEEE P1619
 *          <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4375278>.
