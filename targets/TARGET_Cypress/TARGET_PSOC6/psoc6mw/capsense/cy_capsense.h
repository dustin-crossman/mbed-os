* \mainpage Cypress CapSense Middleware Library
********************************************************************************
*
* CapSense is a Cypress capacitive sensing solution. Capacitive sensing can be 
* used in a variety of applications and products where conventional mechanical 
* buttons can be replaced with sleek human interfaces to transform the way 
* users interact with electronic systems. These include home appliances, and
* automotive, IoT, and industrial applications. CapSense supports multiple 
* interfaces (widgets) using both CSX and CSD sensing methods with robust 
* performance.
* 
********************************************************************************
* \section section_capsense_general General Description
********************************************************************************
*
* A CapSense solution includes a configuration wizard to create and configure 
* CapSense widgets, an API to control the design from the application firmware,
* and the CapSense Tuner tool for tuning, testing, and debugging for 
* easy and smooth design of human interfaces on customer products. 
*
* Include cy_capsense.h to get access to all functions and other declarations 
* in this library. If you are using the ModusToolbox CapSense Configurator, 
* you can include cycfg_capsense.h only.
*

*   testing, and debugging
* * Provides superior immunity against external noise and low-radiated 
*   emission
* * Offers best-in-class liquid tolerance

*
* \subsection subsection_capsense_usage When to use a CapSense
* 
* CapSense has become a popular technology to replace conventional 
* mechanical- and optical- based user interfaces. There are fewer parts 
* involved, which saves cost and increases reliability, with no wear-and-tear. 
* The main advantages of CapSense compared with other solutions are:  
* robust performance in harsh environmental conditions and rejection of a 
* wide range of external noise sources. 
* 
* Use CapSense for:
* * Touch and gesture detection for various interfaces
* * Proximity detection for innovative user experiences and low-power 
*   optimization
* * Replacement for the IR-based proximity detection, which is sensitive 
*   to skin and colors
* * Contactless liquid-level sensing in a variety of applications
* * Touch-free operations in hazardous materials
* 
********************************************************************************
* \section section_capsense_configuration Configuration Considerations
********************************************************************************
*
* The CapSense operates on the top of the CapSense Sigma Delta (CSD) driver.
* Refer to the PDL API Reference Manual.
*
* This document includes the Application Programming Interface (API). It provides 
* descriptions of the functions in the firmware library, and descriptions 
* of the data structures (Register map) used by the firmware library.
* 
* The Application Programming Interface (API) routines allow controlling and 
* executing specific tasks using the CapSense middleware. The CapSense API 
* is described in the following sections:
* * \ref group_capsense_high_level
* * \ref group_capsense_low_level
* * \ref group_capsense_data_structure
* * \ref group_capsense_enums
* * \ref group_capsense_macros

/** \addtogroup group_capsense_data_structure

*
* The CapSense Data Structure organizes configuration parameters, input, and 
* output data shared among different FW modules within the CapSense. 
* 
* The key responsibilities of the Data Structure are as follows:
* * The Data Structure is the only data container in the Component.
* * It serves as storage for the configuration and the output data.
* * All CapSense modules use the data structure for the communication 
*   and data exchange.
* 
* The CapSense Data Structure is a composite of several smaller structures 
* (for global / common data, widget data, sensor data, and pin data). 
* Furthermore, the data is split between RAM and Flash to achieve a 
* reasonable balance between resources consumption and configuration / tuning 
* flexibility at runtime and compile time. A graphical representation of 
* the CapSense Data Structure is shown below.
* 
* Note that figure below shows a sample representation and documents the 
* high-level design of the data structure, it does not include all the 
* parameters and elements in each object.

/** \addtogroup group_capsense_callbacks
* \{
*
* Callbacks allow a user to execute custom code called from CapSense 
* middleware when some events occur. CapSense supports two callbacks.
*
* <table>

*     <th >Callback Name</th>
*     <th>Associated Register</th>

*   </tr>
*   <tr>
*     <td>End Of Scan</td>
*     <td>ptrEOSCallback</td>
*     <td>It is called after when sensor scan is finished and there is no other 
*         sensors in queue to be scanned.</td>
*   </tr>
* </table>
*
* \note
* These callbacks are called by the Cy_CapSense_InterruptHandler() function and
* lengthen its execution. Usually, Cy_CapSense_InterruptHandler() is called inside the
* CSD ISR. In such a case, the callbacks mentioned lengthen the execution of the CSD ISR as well.
*
* To assign user's functions to these callbacks present in the middleware, 
* perform the following:
*   
* * Write the function implementation (in any user file) using the following 
*   function prototype:
*   
*   <tt>void CallbackFunction(cy_stc_active_scan_sns_t * ptrActiveScan);</tt>
*   
* * Use the \ref Cy_CapSense_RegisterCallback() API to register the callback
*   function to be executed when the \ref cy_en_capsense_callback_event_t occurs, 
*   or assign the function to a corresponding CapSense Data Structure register, 
*   located in cy_stc_capsense_common_context_t:
*   
*   <tt>context-\>ptrCommonContext-\>\<Associated Register\> = \&CallbackFunction;</tt>
* 
* To unassign user's functions from these callbacks present in the middleware, 
* perform the following:
*
* * Use the \ref Cy_CapSense_UnRegisterCallback() API to unregister the callback
*   function that was previously assigned to be the executer when the specified
*   \ref cy_en_capsense_callback_event_t occurs, or assign NULL to a corresponding
*   CapSense Data Structure register, located in cy_stc_capsense_common_context_t:
*
*   <tt>context-\>ptrCommonContext-\>\<Associated Register\> = NULL;</tt>
