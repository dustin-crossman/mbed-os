 * \brief PSA cryptography module: Mbed TLS platfom definitions
 *
 * \note This file may not be included directly. Applications must
 * include psa/crypto.h.
 *
 * This file contains platform-dependent type definitions.
 *
 * In implementations with isolation between the application and the
 * cryptography module, implementers should take care to ensure that
 * the definitions that are exposed to applications match what the
 * module implements.
