/**
 * Representation of a characteristic discovered.
 *
 * Instances of this class are generated by the GattClient discovery procedure
 * initiated with GattClient::launchServiceDiscovery().
 *
 * It exposes the main attributes of the discovered characteristic:
 *   - The UUID of the characteristic, it can be retrieved by a call to the
 *     function getUUID(). This UUID is the type of the characteristic.
 *   - Attribute Handles of the characteristic are present as the triplet
 *     declaration handle, value handle and last handle. The value handle is
 *     used to read or write the content of the characteristic.
 *   - The properties contain the set of operations the characteristic can
 *     handle, for instance being read or written.
 *
 * It important to note that the value of the characteristic - if it is
 * accessible - is not fetched at discovery time.
 *
 * The main operations offered by the class are reading, writing and discovering
 * the descriptors of the characteristic discovered.
 *
 * Reading a discovered characteristic can be accomplished in two different
 * fashion:
 *
 * If the user has a callback registered for the data read operation in the
 * GattClient then a call to the read(uint16_t) function will initiate a read of
 * the characteristic. Results of the operation will be pass on the callback
 * registered by GattClient::onDataRead() which process all the responses to
 * read requests. The read request for a given characteristic can be identified
 * by the connection handle and the attribute handle which are present in
 * GattReadCallbackParams.
 *
 * Another overload (read(uint16_t, const GattClient::ReadCallback_t&)) of the
 * read function accept a completion callback as a last parameter. That
 * completion callback will be invoked automatically once the response to the
 * read request for that given characteristic has been received. However
 * convenience came at the expense of dynamic memory usage for the time of the
 * transaction.
 *
 * Similarly, two versions of the write() API are exposed. One where the user
 * has to register a callback handling write response via the function
 * GattClient::onDataWritten() and another one which accept a completion
 * callback in input.
 *
 * It is also possible to send a write command which is not acknowledged by the
 * peer server by using the function writeWoResponse().
 *
 * Finally descriptors of the characteristic can be discovered by invoking the
 * function discoverDescriptors which is a shorthand for calling
 * GattClient::discoverCharacteristicDescriptors. That discovery is necessary to
 * enable or disable characteristic notification or indication which is achieved
 * by writing on the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD).
